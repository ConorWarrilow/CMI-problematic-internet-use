# CMI-problematic-internet-use

## Summary
Problematic internet use among children and adolescents is a growing concern. Better understanding this issue is crucial for addressing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.

## Goal
The goal is to develop a predictive model aimed towards identifying problematic internet usage in children and adolescents based on their physical activity and fitness data. 
More specificially, we are to predict a participant's Severity Impairment Index (SII) of problematic internet use. SII is derived from PCIAT-PCIAT_Total, the sum of scores from the Parent-Child Internet Addiction Test (PCIAT: 20 questions, scored 0-5).
SII is an ordinal categorical variable, defined as:
0: None (PCIAT-PCIAT_Total from 0 to 30)
1: Mild (PCIAT-PCIAT_Total from 31 to 49)
2: Moderate (PCIAT-PCIAT_Total from 50 to 79)
3: Severe (PCIAT-PCIAT_Total 80 to 100)



# The Dataset
The data used for this competition was provided by the Healthy Brain Network, a landmark mental health study based in New York City.

The data comprises roughly 5,000 participants aged 5-22 years, 3,960 of which are contained within the train set.
